SmithWaterman.java has methods that allow users to get the score, p-value, and print out of a comparision.

In order to use SmithWaterman.java, just create a new SmithWaterman object. Example:

    SmithWaterman ex1 = new SmithWaterman("str001", "str002", "deadly", "ddgearlyk", 999);
    int score = ex1.score();
    double p-val = ex1.pval();
    ex1.printAlignment();
